 I learned a lot in my 2025 web deisign class but one thing
 I learned the most was how to code in HTML and CSS.
 I also learned how to make a website look more neat
 to other people by using different colors and fonts.
 I also learned how to make my website more user friendly
 by adding links to different pages. It was fun to be part of
 the 2025-2026 web design class.
